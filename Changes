Revision history for Perl extension Test::C2FIT.

0.08  Wed Jan 24 2008
    - Reimplemented isnumber to using code fragment from Perl Cookbook.
    - Christophe Hermier submitted Bug Fix to TypeAdapter's isnumber method.

0.07  Sun Jun 04 2006   Martin Busik <martin.busik@busik.de>
    - all calls to subs in Test::C2FIT-Packages is now done in the
      "method" style, e.g. pkg->subname and not pkg::subname
      (as only this style allows usage of static methods in subclasses)
    - all constructor calls now pkg->new instead of new pkg()
    - error handling in all Test::C2FIT classes now consistently
      try/catch/otherwise
    - unicode-characters handling in the spec (esp. nbsp (&#0160;))
      modified. Perl creates internally (at least under 5.8.8) utf8
      byte sequences. Input files are expected to be in iso-8859-* or
      windows-1252 so these characters may be encoded by a single byte.
      Therefore, a bit unpretty handling was implemented
    - new makefile-target my_tidy - formats
    - further tests in the t directory added
0.06  Sat May 13 2006   Martin Busik <martin.busik@busik.de>
    - Makefile.PL regarding META.yml modified
    - fit_shell, an interactive shell for easy running the tests
      added.
    - startet with pod documentation
    - filtering of diagnostic messages a la (java) commonLogging
      implemented.

	- Release to include missing files which had been submitted by Martin.

0.02  Mon May 1 2006    Martin Busik <martin.busik@busik.de>
	- simple entry point for FileRunner and WikiRunner
		perl -MTest::C2FIT -e file_runner <input-file> <output-file>
	- Output and result code of FileRunner and WikiRunner identical to
		the reference implementation (java implementation, version 1.1).
	- loading of Fixtures/Packages modified.
		The specification requires the usage of java-style package
		separators ("." instead of the perl-style "::"). Further, the
		(input) documents shall use fully qualified package names. In
		order to allow the usage of at least the specification documents
		without change, special care is taken of the "fit.*" names.
		Similar rules apply to "eg.*" and "fat.*" names.
		The loader does not require each referenced package to be in a
		separate file now.
	- Added better support for TypeAdapters.
		Test::C2FIT::Fixture implements the following methods which,
		given a field or method name, returns the (fully qualified) package
		name of the appropriate TypeAdapter:
		suggestFieldType - used in ColumnFixture an RowFixture
		suggestMethodResultType - used in ColumnFixture, RowFixture and 
			ActionFixture
		suggestMethodParamType - used in ActionFixture
		by default, these methods make a lookup in an instance's hash. So 
		either these methods are to overload or the appropriate hashes 
		are to be filled.
	- ActionFixture
		loading of fixtures (see above)
		added TypeAdapter-support in do_enter
	- ColumnFixture
		Bug in check() fixed. When execute() was called within the check()
		method and execute() raised an exception, further handling ignored
		this. (This bug is still exists in V1.1 of the java implementation)
	- Fixture
		TypeAdapter support (see above)
		Bug in doRows fixed. Wrong iterator implementation, causing endless
		loops if doRow() added further rows to the output.
		implementation of exception() now identical to the java impl.
		Implementation of check() regarding empty cells modified, behavior
		now identical to the java impl.
		Error text in loadFixture() modified according to the specification
		(less verbose)
	- GenericArrayAdapter
		implementation of equals modified.
	- Parse
		Empty tags, e.g. "<td/>" will be now correctly parsed. Until yet,
		there were an exeption (same problem occurs in the V1.1 of the
		reference implementation)
		Added dummy implementation of footnote()
	- RowFixture
		Printout of surplus rows corrected.
	- TimedActionFixture
		Time is printed in human readable form now
	- TypeAdapter
		Added better support for (specific) TypeAdapters
		Implmenentation of equals() changed. In java, equals() is a method
		of Object, it can be generally used. This is not required in perl,
		but needed, when (propably) blessed objects are in place (e.g.
	    { a => 1, b => 2 } eq { a => 1, b => 2} is not true).
		The current implementation accomodates this.
		For numeric comparison, the ScientificDouble is used
		(as this is the lesser evil than abs($a - b) < 0.00001 :)
		Given an undef, toString return now "null" (as in the V1.1 of
		the reference implementation)
	- Generally: Behavior checked against the version 1.1 of the java
	  	implementation. 
	- All examples of the reference implementation now also included.
		The results are as identical to the reference implementation as
		possible (e.g. "integer overflow")
	- MINOR changes in the examples/input/*.html files.
		Some files contained path specifiations with wildcards
		(e.g. "Documents/AllFiles/magnitude/*.html) In order to get these
		running, "Documents" was replaced by "input".
		The WebPageExample refers now to URLs which (at present: 2006-05-01)
		exist.
	- examples-perl added
		Contains an example which uses the above mentioned TypeAdapter 
		features.
